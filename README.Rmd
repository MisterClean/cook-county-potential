## Installation

You can install the released version of `ptaxsim` directly from GitLab by running the following R command after installing [remotes](https://github.com/r-lib/remotes):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_gitlab("ccao-data-science---modeling/packages/ptaxsim")
```

Occasionally, when using brand-new or source versions of packages, installation [on Windows will fail with the following error](https://github.com/rstudio/renv/issues/162):

```
DLL 'package_name' not found: maybe not installed for this architecture?
```

If this happens, try using the following installation command:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_gitlab(
  repo = "ccao-data-science---modeling/packages/ptaxsim",
  INSTALL_opts = "--no-multiarch"
)
```
