\description{
Cook County is made up of numerous independent taxing bodies
  (AKA agencies or districts) that all receive funding from property taxes.
  The amount each district receives is determined by its levy. The pool of
  available value each district can tax is known as its base/total EAV.

  Each district's individual tax rate is determined by dividing its levy by
  its base EAV.
